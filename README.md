### Introduction
**Gravity Simulation** is a 2D survival game where the player dodges from energy balls and laser beams. The goal is to achieve the best score before the game is over. I implemented features including,  ```the player changing the gravity upside down```, ```random tile generator for the speed```, ```barrier shell to protect```, ```an enemy shooting projectiles when it hits the wall```, and ```shadow motions```.

### How to play
The player should avoid from fatal weapons, and take the highest score until the player dies. Use Barrier Shell to protect, and change gravity upside down!

- **Move keys**: ```A``` And ```D```
- Skills:
  - **Change Gravity**: ```NumPad 1```
  - **Barrier Shell**: ``` NumPad 2```

### Features
- Programmed ```singleton design pettern``` to create a single ownership to summon a lot of projectiles or units
- Implemented ```unit``` that has a trigger when it collides to the wall
- Implemented ```Map System``` supports to transfer different map textures every time
- Implemented ```Camera System``` supports to follow the player position
- Implemented ```Barrier Shell``` supports to the player gets protected by projectiles
- Implemented ```Shadow motions``` supports to create shadow following the player
- Implemented ```HUD``` supports to display user interface in gameplay
